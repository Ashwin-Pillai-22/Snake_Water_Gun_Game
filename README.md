# Snake-Water-Gun Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic "Snake-Water-Gun" game, a fun and simple game you can play against the computer.

## How the Game Works:

- There are three entities in the game: **Snake**, **Water**, and **Gun**.
- The interactions between the entities follow these rules:
  1. **Snake**:
     - **Wins against Water** (Snake drinks water).
     - **Loses to Gun** (Gun kills snake).
  2. **Water**:
     - **Wins against Gun** (Water rusts the gun).
     - **Loses to Snake** (Snake drinks water).
  3. **Gun**:
     - **Wins against Snake** (Gun kills snake).
     - **
